# CS513_Assignment_2
Sieve of Eratosthenes in CUDA

Improve on the prime finding algorithm of last class to achieve a theoretical sqrt(n)*loglogn running time with sqrt(n) processors. Implement your algorithm.

(On "improvement" I mean you should use your imagination and your algorithm is allowed to significantly differ from what we have discussed. The solution i see uses the original Erasthotenes idea but in a different way than the algorithm we have discussed.)
